At CERN there are many sites of interest that live and are maintained beyond the public site.
If you had a look at the new beta, you problaly noticed that some of the content displayed has been aggregated from other sites. The way we categorize this content depends on the audience.

You can find this content:

- on the [Students and Educators](https://cern.ch/students-educators) section, displaying the Summer Student Lecture Programme
- on the [Scientist](https://cern.ch/scientists) section, where we aggregate "News from around he web", "CERN Courier news" and "Recent publications"
- on the [CERN people](https://cern.ch/cern-people) section, where we show "News from around CERN", "Staff association updates", today's events, service interventios and available trainings for CERN users.

If you know other sites producing content that could be interesting for students, educators, scientists or CERN people [get in touch!](mailto:web-team-editors@cern.ch?subject=Aggregation%20of%20content%20on%20the%20new%20Public%20site)
